"""Tests of the ``(type, performative)`` generator registry and its dispatch gauntlet.

Port of the Java ``NegotiationGeneratorRegistryTest``: every type-and-phase combination resolves
its generator, the family / runtime-type / conclusion guards reject the mismatches with the exact
Java messages (programming errors as ``TypeError``/``ValueError``), a conclusion mismatch carries
the coded ``negotiation.conclusion_mismatch`` failure, and an unknown registry key is a programming
error, never a business failure.
