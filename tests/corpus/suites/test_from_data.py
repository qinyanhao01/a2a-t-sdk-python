"""Data-driven suite of the from-data family corpus: every from-data case becomes one test.

Port of the Java ``FromDataCorpusSuiteTest`` (through the case-test half of ``CorpusSuites``):
every record under ``tests/resources/negotiation-cases/from-data/`` — the two families
FD-HAPPY (the deterministic generation matrix, every case carrying a zero-LLM-call proof) and
FD-PROG (the absorbed 22-row programming-error matrix), the bilingual ones expanded once per
declared language — becomes one parametrized test executed by the
:class:`~tests.corpus.engine.CaseEngine` against the production negotiation content wiring: the
four ``generate*FromData`` service methods over the real orchestrator built through the real
builder, the typed input assembled from ``input.data`` by the real typed-input assembler.

The zero-LLM-call proof is structural: the engine runs every from-data case on the
assertion-only client — any call the deterministic pipeline made would fail the run with the
assertion marker — and every shipped case also expects ``llmCalls == 0``. The engine owns the
per-case assertions (the outcome, the Java exception name through the D22 shim, the error code,
the message fragments, the exact ``llmCalls`` count, the prompt-text fragments, the metadata
echoes and the P0 contracts), so the suite test itself is one engine run, exactly like the Java
dynamic test. What the suite adds is the collection half: the guard tests pin that the
parametrize sweeps the whole directory — every corpus file contributes, all four from-data APIs
and both language halves run, every case proves zero calls, and the programming-error matrix
covers both failure carriers (the coded business failures and the D22-shimmed programming
errors) — so an accidentally empty or partial collection fails loudly instead of silently
contributing no test (the fail-fast inversion of the Java ``noteEmpty`` stdout note). The red
paths prove the driver is not a rubber stamp: a flipped outcome, a non-zero call-count
expectation and a wrong Java exception name each fail with the case id and the JSON path.

The corpus ids are the pytest ids, so a subset runs through ``-k`` the way the Java suites use
``-Dcase.filter``: ``-k FD-PROG`` runs the programming-error matrix, ``-k "FD-HAPPY and
en-US"`` the English deterministic legs.
