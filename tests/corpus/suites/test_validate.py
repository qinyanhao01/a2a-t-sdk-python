"""Data-driven suite of the validate family corpus: every validate case becomes one test.

Port of the Java ``ValidateCorpusSuiteTest`` (through the case-test half of ``CorpusSuites``):
every record under ``tests/resources/negotiation-cases/validate/`` — the eight families
VAL-HAPPY, VAL-RULE, VAL-SEM, VAL-RETRY, VAL-MERGE, VAL-MAP, VAL-PROG and VAL-DRIFT, each
expanded once per declared language — becomes one parametrized test executed by the
:class:`~tests.corpus.engine.CaseEngine` against the production negotiation content wiring: the
four ``validate*PromptAndDataFilling`` service methods over the real rule gate, semantic
validator and parameter extractor, with the LLM seam scripted per case (zero-call probes run on
the assertion-only client).

The engine owns the per-case assertions — the outcome, the Java exception name through the D22
shim, the error code, message fragments, the exact bag of slot errors, the exact ``llmCalls``
count, the merged parameter map and the P0 contracts — so the suite test itself is one engine
run, exactly like the Java dynamic test. What the suite adds is the collection half: the guard
tests pin that the parametrize sweeps the whole directory — every corpus file contributes, all
four validate APIs and both prompt-source kinds run, and the zero-call rule-gate probes sit side
by side with the multi-call retry legs — so an accidentally empty or partial collection fails
loudly instead of silently contributing no test (the fail-fast inversion of the Java
``noteEmpty`` stdout note). One flipped expectation of a shipped case proves the driver is not a
rubber stamp.

The corpus ids are the pytest ids, so a subset runs through ``-k`` the way the Java suites use
``-Dcase.filter``: ``-k VAL-RULE`` runs the rule gate in both languages, ``-k "VAL-MAP and
zh-CN"`` the zh-CN-only error-code mapping.
