"""Metadata model of generated A2A-T messages.

Port of the Java ``core/model`` triple :class:`MetadataContent`, :class:`NegotiationContext` and
``NegotiationPerformative``, plus the extension URI constants of Java ``ExtensionUriConstants``. A
generated message travels in A2A-T metadata under its extension URI
together with the template it was rendered from and, for negotiation messages, the session context
of the negotiation it belongs to; :meth:`MetadataContent.build_metadata_content` builds that map.

The performative carries the communicative intent of a negotiation message (plan 7.5: a performative
is a speech act, not a state-machine phase). How a performative maps to a prompt template is a
concern of the negotiation layer, not of this module.
