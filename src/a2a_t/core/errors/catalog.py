"""Closed catalog of the machine-readable error codes exposed by the A2A-T SDK.

Port of Java ``a2a-t-core`` ``net.openan.a2at.sdk.core.exception.ErrorCatalog`` (1.1.0). Each member
carries the layered ``domain.semantic`` code string (for example ``content.param_missing``), the
:class:`Category` that decides which exception family carries it, and the names of the fact
parameters the message template of the code renders. Message templates live in
``prompt_resources/errors/{language}/errors.json``; use :mod:`a2a_t.core.errors.messages` to render
them.

The catalog is closed: codes returned by an LLM step that are not in this catalog are mapped to the
per-domain ``*.rule_violation`` fallback members by the callers, never surfaced raw (D4: the enum is
the internal carrier, ``str`` is the external one — use ``ErrorCatalog.value`` / ``code_str``).
