## Feasibility Negotiation
{{feasibility_negotiation_summary}} (required)
Requirement:
1. State whether the feasibility assessment category is goal achievement or solution feasibility
2. State the category of this round's message, taking one of the following:
   - **Initiate feasibility assessment**: Propose the target or solution to be evaluated, and this side has not yet given a conclusion (whether it is the first proposal, or a re-initiation after adjusting the target or solution following an infeasible evaluation in the previous round, it falls into this category)
   - **Assess as feasible and request confirmation**: This side has completed the assessment, the conclusion is feasible, and the counterparty needs to confirm whether to proceed with this
   - **Assess as infeasible and propose**: This side has completed the assessment, the conclusion is infeasible, and the counterparty needs to confirm the handling strategy
3. If it is "Initiate feasibility assessment", reference <Under Evaluation Description>, and state the action expected of the counterparty: "please assess"; if this is a re-initiation after an infeasible evaluation in the previous round, state the changes in this round relative to the previous round, without repeating the unchanged parts
4. If it is "Assess as feasible and request confirmation", reference <Feasible Evaluation Confirmation Request>, and briefly state that the assessment conclusion is feasible, without expanding the assessment process details
5. If it is "Assess as infeasible and propose", reference <Infeasible Evaluation Details and Proposal>
6. Keep it concise, one to two sentences, without expanding or restating the specific content

Example 1 (first initiation of assessment): The energy saving task request has been received. Please help assess whether the energy saving goal can be achieved. See <Under Evaluation Description> for details. Please assess.
Example 2 (proposing a solution to initiate assessment): During the execution of the fault subscription task, self-diagnosis identified a viable keepalive solution. See <Under Evaluation Description> for details. Please assess whether this solution can be adopted.
Example 3 (re-initiating assessment after adjustment): Regarding the previous conflict between the rate guarantee goal and the power outage duration requirement, the rate guarantee goal has been adjusted from 5Mbps down to 2Mbps. See <Under Evaluation Description> for details. Please re-assess whether this goal can be achieved.
Example 4 (assess as feasible and request confirmation): Regarding the adjusted rate guarantee goal, the feasibility assessment has been completed, and the conclusion is feasible. Please reply to <Feasible Evaluation Confirmation Request>.
Example 5 (assess as infeasible and propose): The feasibility assessment for goal achievement of the site-level energy saving task has been completed. The current rate goal cannot simultaneously satisfy the power outage duration requirement. See <Infeasible Evaluation Details and Proposal> for details. Please confirm.

## Under Evaluation Description
{{under_evaluation_description}} (optional)
Requirement:
1. Provide this section only when the category of this round's message is "Initiate feasibility assessment"
2. State whether the item to be evaluated belongs to goal achievement or solution feasibility
3. For goal achievement, describe: the goal content, and the solution or resource status on which the goal depends; if this is a re-initiation after an infeasible evaluation in the previous round, additionally state the adjusted value and the basis for the adjustment
4. For solution feasibility, describe: the candidate solution content to be evaluated (one or more), the resources required by the solution and whether there is a potential association with existing constraints; if this is a re-initiation after an infeasible evaluation in the previous round, additionally state the replacement/adjusted solution content
5. This side does not provide a conclusion, only the complete information of the object to be evaluated, to avoid omissions that would leave the counterparty with insufficient basis for assessment
6. Related items must be described one by one, not only listing some of them

Example: The target to be evaluated is the rate guarantee goal of the site-level energy saving task during the 08:00~18:00 period, which has been adjusted from the original 5Mbps down to 2Mbps. The basis for the adjustment is to accommodate the power outage duration guarantee requirement during the 08:00~18:00 period. Please assess whether this adjusted rate goal can be achieved, and whether it can simultaneously satisfy the original power outage duration guarantee requirement.

## Infeasible Evaluation Details and Proposal
{{infeasible_evaluation_details_and_proposal}} (optional)
Requirement:
1. Provide this section only when the category of this round's message is "Assess as infeasible and propose"
2. State whether the assessment belongs to goal achievement or solution feasibility
3. For goal achievement, describe: the goal content, whether there is self-contradiction or multi-goal conflict, whether the dependent solution or resources are available, and state the basis for the judgment
4. For solution feasibility, describe: the candidate solution content (one or more), whether the resources required by each solution are available, and whether there is a conflict with existing constraints
5. Give a clear conclusion of infeasible
6. State the basis
7. Provide adjustment suggestions or feasible candidate solutions
8. Related items must be described one by one, not only listing some of them

Example:
This assessment targets the goal achievement feasibility of the site-level energy saving task.
The original request requires the xx site to deliver an energy saving guaranteed rate of 5Mbps during the 08:00~18:00 period, while the site has an existing constraint of guaranteeing at least 10 hours of power supply duration under power outage scenarios.
Upon assessment, if the 5Mbps rate guarantee goal is executed, the equipment power consumption during this period cannot satisfy the power outage duration requirement. The two requirements conflict, and the basis for this judgment is the current backup power capacity of the site and the historical power consumption curve.
Conclusion: Infeasible.
Proposal: Regarding the conflict between the rate guarantee goal and the power outage duration requirement, it is recommended to adjust the rate guarantee goal from 5Mbps down to 2Mbps, so as to extend the supportable power outage duration to the required 10 hours. If the rate reduction cannot be accepted, the power outage duration guarantee requirement must be shortened accordingly.
One of the two must be adjusted; there is currently no third option that can simultaneously satisfy the original two requirements.

## Feasible Evaluation Confirmation Request
{{feasibility_confirm_request}} (optional)
Requirement:
1. Provide this section only when the category of this round's message is "Assess as feasible and request confirmation"
2. Combined with the assessment category, initiate the confirmation to the counterparty, with the wording fixed as:
   - If the assessed content is **goal achievement**: "The target is assessed as feasible. Do you agree to proceed with this target?"
   - If the assessed content is **solution feasibility**: "The solution is assessed as feasible. Do you agree to proceed with this solution?"
3. It is generally used by the executor of the original intent to confirm with the initiator of the original intent whether to continue the process

Example 1 (goal achievement, feasible): The target is assessed as feasible. Do you agree to proceed with this target?
Example 2 (solution feasibility, feasible): The solution is assessed as feasible. Do you agree to proceed with this solution?
