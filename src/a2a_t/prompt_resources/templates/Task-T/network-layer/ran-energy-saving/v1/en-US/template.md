## Operation Type

{{operation_type}} (required)

Requirement:

1. Please provide the operation type. Allowed values: Create, Modify

## Task Type

Wireless network energy saving

## Task Description

{{task_description}} (required)

Requirement:

1. Please dynamically provide the task description based on <Operation Type> (Create/Modify):
   - When the type is [Create]: Based on <Task Object> and <Task Context>, output a wireless network energy saving plan that achieves the wireless network energy saving goal defined in <Task Target>, and return the wireless network energy saving result in the format defined in <Expected Output>.
   - When the type is [Modify]: Based on <Task Object> and <Task Context>, output a wireless network energy saving plan that achieves the wireless network energy saving goal defined in <Task Target>.

## Task Object

{{task_object}} (required)

Requirement:

1. Area name: (required)
   - Explicitly specify the energy saving coverage scope information, a geographic or logical area (e.g., district-level administrative unit)
   - Must be a concrete and physically real community name such as "Songshanhu Administration Committee", rather than a description without a specific physical location such as "all communities", "indoor communities", or "outdoor communities"
   - Example: Area: "Songshanhu Administration Committee"

## Task Target

{{task_target}} (optional)

Requirement:

1. Define the quantitative or qualitative goals the task must achieve. Quantitative and qualitative goals cannot be selected at the same time, and the default is a qualitative goal. The specific description of energy saving goals is as follows:
   - Quantitative goal: Energy consumption goal; the gain target of energy saving. The target value format must be a percentage, such as the percentage by which total power consumption is reduced. Example: Energy consumption goal: 30%
   - Qualitative goal: Maximize energy saving under the conditions defined in the task context

## Task Context

{{task_context}} (optional)

Requirement:

1. Cell radio access technology for energy saving (LTE/NR/all). Example: Cell RAT for energy saving: NR
2. The time range for executing energy saving, recurring daily. If omitted, energy saving is performed for the full period. **The rate goal is guaranteed only within the energy saving enabled time range**. Example: Energy saving time range: start time "08:00:00", end time "12:00:00"
3. Carrier frequencies that can be turned off during energy saving. Example: Downlink frequency numbers: 1650, 1600
4. Rate guarantee goal: the minimum downlink throughput target that must be guaranteed and its effective time period.

   - **For the area-level setting**, the following information needs to be provided:

     Option 1:
     - Time-segmented rate guarantee goal (required). For time periods without a rate guarantee goal set, experience-lossless energy saving is adopted by default, with a maximum of three rate values
     - Example: Time-segmented rate guarantee goal: {00:00~06:00,2Mbps}, {06:00~18:00,10Mbps}

     Option 2:
     - Full-period rate guarantee goal (required)
     - Example: Rate guarantee goal: 10Mbps

   - **For the site-level setting**, the following information needs to be provided:
     - Site list (required)
     - Time-segmented rate guarantee goal (required). For time periods without a rate guarantee goal set, experience-lossless energy saving is adopted by default, with a maximum of three rate values
     - Background event and event duration (optional)
     - Example:
       - Site list 1: ["Site Name 1", "Site Name 2"], Time-segmented rate guarantee goal: {00:00~06:00,2Mbps}, {06:00~18:00,10Mbps}, Background event: power outage from 00:00 to 18:00.
       - Site list 2: ["Site Name 3", "Site Name 4"], Time-segmented rate guarantee goal: {01:00~06:00,2Mbps}, {06:00~18:00,10Mbps}, Background event: power outage from 01:00 to 18:00.

## Expected Output

{{expected_output}} (optional when creating, not required when modifying)

Requirement:

1. When the task object is a geographic/logical area, output the intent report for the network energy saving task. The intent report should contain the following information:

### Intent Report Basic Information

1. Unique identifier of the network energy saving report
2. Unique identifier of the energy saving task
3. Execution result of the overall intent, including the execution result status and execution result details. If the goal is not achieved, describe the specific reason for not achieving it

### Intent Report Detailed Information

1. Execution result of specific KPIs, including the execution result status and execution result details. If the goal is not achieved, describe the specific reason for not achieving it
