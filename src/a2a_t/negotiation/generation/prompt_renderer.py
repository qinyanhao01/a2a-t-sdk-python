"""Negotiation render step on top of the drop blank-slot section policy (port of Java
``NegotiationPromptRenderer``).

A negotiation template is split into sections on ``## `` title lines; any content before the first
title, including a leading HTML description comment, is discarded. A section whose first non-empty
body line is a slot placeholder line such as ``{{required_information_items}} (required)`` — or the
same shape with the full-width required/optional markers used by zh-CN templates — is a slot
section: it is rendered as the title followed by the slot value, or dropped entirely when the slot
value is ``None`` or blank. Every other section is static and passes through with placeholder
substitution applied. Rendered sections are joined with a single blank line and the result carries
no trailing newline.

The rendering itself delegates to the shared :func:`a2a_t.prompt.task_rendering.sectioned_renderer.drop_sections`
of the prompt kernel, which owns the drop policy of the sectioned template grammar (D12). Unlike
the delegate's own ``TypeError`` null guard, this adapter rejects a ``None`` template text with the
internal :class:`NegotiationRenderError` instead, so the orchestration layer wraps the failure into
the typed negotiation generation failure ``template.render_failed`` (carrying the ``template_uri``
and ``reason`` facts) rather than letting it leak.
