"""Typed content model of negotiation messages (port of the Java ``content`` records).

The Java records are pure data carriers by design: no compact constructor validates any component.
Blank descriptions, ``None`` conclusions and ``None`` actions stay representable so the generation
pipeline can translate them into the coded business failure ``negotiation.content_invalid``, the
extractor failure ``negotiation.field_missing`` / ``negotiation.content_extract_failed`` or the
programming-error :class:`TypeError` at the exact call site that requires them (the Java
``FromDataProgrammingErrorMatrixTest`` pins the same split). Mirroring that contract exactly,
these dataclasses perform no ``__post_init__`` validation either — the one piece of content
validation Java duplicated in the generators and the extractor lives in
:mod:`a2a_t.negotiation.content.confirm_request` (D14), and the addressing validation lives in
:class:`a2a_t.negotiation.resources.reference.NegotiationReference`.

Field nullability follows the Java ``@Nullable`` annotations: fields declared nullable there are
``| None`` here, and fields declared non-null there (``conclusion``, ``action``, the required
summaries) keep their non-optional annotations while still accepting ``None`` at runtime, exactly
like an unvalidated Java record. A ``None`` list and an empty list are distinct values; both omit
the section they drive when rendered.

One deliberate divergence: Java records hash structurally (``List.hashCode``), while these
dataclasses carry real lists and are therefore unhashable whenever they hold items. Equality is
the supported identity operation; callers needing a hash key should key on an explicit projection.
