"""Shared confirm-request mutual-exclusion validation of propose content (D14).

A propose round of the target and feasibility families has a third, derived message category
beyond the two enum actions: "requesting confirmation". The category is expressed by a non-blank
confirm-request text on the content, and it is strongly exclusive — a confirm-request round
carries only the summary and the confirm request, so the conditional item lists of the family must
all be empty and (feasibility only) the action must be ``REQUEST_FEASIBILITY_EVALUATION``.

Java implements this validation twice — once in the from-data generators
(``TargetProposeGenerator`` / ``FeasibilityProposeGenerator``) and once in the from-text extractor
(``DefaultNegotiationContentExtractor.mapTargetProposeContent`` / ``mapFeasibilityProposeContent``)
— which is evolutionary accident, not design (port plan J-4). This module is the single shared
validation function both call sites of the P5 generation pipeline consume; the templates and the
bilingual extraction prompts keep their soft wording as a second line of defence.

Error codes: every Java site raises ``negotiation.invalid_input`` carrying a single ``reason``
fact with a family-specific English sentence. The catalog also defines
``negotiation.mutually_exclusive_sections``, but no Java production site raises it (it exists for
LLM-returned semantic codes resolved by the validation pipeline), so the shared function raises
exactly what the Java sites raise — ``NegotiationGenerationError`` with
``ErrorCatalog.NEGOTIATION_INVALID_INPUT`` and the ``reason`` fact.

    """Validate the confirm-request round of one propose content against its conditional sections.

    The check runs only when the confirm request is present (non-``None`` and non-blank). It then
    enforces, in the Java sites' order:

    1. the action the confirm-request category requires, when the family carries an action
       (feasibility only): a confirm request combined with another action is rejected first;
    2. the strong mutual exclusion: any conditional section holding at least one item next to the
       confirm request is rejected.

    The failure reason names every conditional section of the family, exactly like the static
    Java messages — not only the sections that actually carry items.

    Args:
        label: family label starting the failure reason, such as ``"Target"`` or ``"Feasibility"``.
        confirm_request: the confirm-request text of the content; blank or ``None`` means the
            round is not a confirm-request round and no validation applies.
        conditional_sections: every conditional section of the family, in template order, mapping
            its display name (used in the failure reason) to its item list; ``None`` and empty
            both omit the section.
        action: the action carried by the content, when the family has one.
        confirm_action: the action the confirm-request category requires, when the family has one.
        language: language used to render the failure message; ``None`` falls back to ``en-US``.
        style: ``"combined"`` renders the from-data generator wording ("must not be combined
            with"), ``"extracted"`` the from-text extractor wording ("extracted together with").

    Raises:
        NegotiationGenerationError: carrying ``negotiation.invalid_input`` with the ``reason``
            fact when the confirm request is combined with the wrong action or with any
            conditional section.
        TypeError: when ``confirm_action`` is given but ``action`` is ``None`` — a caller
            contract violation; both Java sites reject a missing action (with a
            ``NullPointerException``) before reaching this validation.
