"""Enums of the negotiation content model (port of the Java ``content`` enums).

:class:`NegotiationType`, :class:`NegotiationAction` and :class:`NegotiationConclusion` mirror
their Java counterparts value-for-value. The performative is deliberately absent: it is a core
model concept owned by :class:`a2a_t.core.metadata.NegotiationPerformative` and reused by this
package (a performative is a speech act, not a negotiation-type-specific phase — port plan 7.5).

Decision D2 is pinned here: :class:`NegotiationConclusion` keeps all three Java values including
``ABORT`` even though the typed generators reject it — the abort message is generated through the
type-independent common abort template instead, and the rejection is a generator concern (P5),
not an enum concern.
