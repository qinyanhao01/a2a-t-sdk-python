"""Domain vocabulary of the negotiation content model (port of the Java ``content/Vocabulary``).

The vocabulary is the single source of the section titles, slot names, appended line labels and
list punctuation used when rendering negotiation messages and when recognising sections inside
received messages. The canonical keys are language-neutral; every supported language exposes
exactly the same key set, while the values match the bundled template bytes of that language
verbatim.

The Java class loads the vocabulary directly from the classpath (negotiation vocabularies are
classpath-fixed and never configurable). This port routes it through the common resource access
layer instead (D13 as overridden by D31): :meth:`Vocabulary.for_language` consumes the layer's
vocabulary loader — packaged by default, locally overridable in ``local_file`` mode — and owns no
IO, caching or path assembly of its own. The strict 37-key contract (a vocabulary that does not
exist, cannot be read, is malformed, or drifts from the canonical key set fails fast with a
catalog-coded ``infra.resource_read_failed`` error) is likewise delegated to the common layer.

Each resolved vocabulary is cached per access object and language, mirroring the Java
resolve-once-per-JVM-and-classloader assembly-time snapshot: an access object's view is frozen for
its lifetime, and a restarted access (the Python equivalent of a restart) re-resolves. The bundled
resource is the source of truth for the key set: 37 canonical keys (the port plan's "41 keys" was
a miscount carried from the pre-port gap analysis).
