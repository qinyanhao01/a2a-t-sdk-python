"""Addressing key for one negotiation template (port of the Java ``resources/NegotiationReference``).

The reference composes the template URI from the type segment and the URI segment of the
performative, so the URI spelling has a single source (:func:`uri_segment_of`). The language is
query context rather than part of the resource identity and is therefore not part of the URI.

The performative has four values while the template URI layer only distinguishes three segments:
``ACCEPT`` and ``REJECT`` share the ``accept-reject`` segment, differing only in the conclusion
value filled into the template slot, and ``ABORT`` is addressed by the single type-independent
common abort template. Typed references address the templates of one negotiation type; the abort
performative is type-independent and is addressed by that common template with a ``None`` type.

This module is a domain type only: template loading stays in the common resource access layer
(D31), so unlike the Java ``resources`` package there is no loader, cache or path assembly here.
