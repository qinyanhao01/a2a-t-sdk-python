"""Packaged prompt-resource reads through ``importlib.resources`` (D8).

Port of the Java ``ClasspathPromptResourceLoader`` / ``ClasspathResourceDirectories`` pair.
Resources are addressed with :class:`~a2a_t.core.prompt_resource_key.PromptResourceKey` paths
(``prompt_resources/...``, relative to the ``a2a_t`` package) and read from the resource tree
shipped inside the package, so wheel, zipapp and source-checkout layouts all work unchanged.

Packaged reads are frozen at first load: every resource path is resolved once and cached at module
level — the Python counterpart of the JVM per-classloader cache, with the package object as the
cache identity. A resource that is missing raises on every call and is never cached, so a resource
that appears later in the same process is picked up (port plan 7.2, "missing is never cached").
Cache mutation relies on plain dict assignment, which is atomic under the GIL; concurrent first
loads of one path may duplicate the read but never corrupt the cache.
