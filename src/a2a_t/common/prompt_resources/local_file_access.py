"""Local prompt-resource root handling: traversal guards and the frozen snapshot (D9).

Port of the Java ``LocalFileResourceSnapshot`` plus the traversal-validation semantics of the
interim ``LocalPromptResourceFiles``: caller-supplied paths must be relative and must never escape
the local root. The snapshot captures the routed subtrees of the local root once, at access-object
construction, and never re-reads them: runtime lookups resolve against the captured map rather than
the filesystem, so local file changes only take effect after the SDK is restarted (D9).

Divergence from the Java snapshot (D31): the routed categories include ``negotiation-vocabulary/``,
because negotiation resources are locally overridable in this port (D13 as overridden by D31); Java
1.1.0 keeps them classpath-fixed and therefore does not snapshot them.
